# Food Insecurity

This project is a part of the Life History Lab.

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to quantify the effect of food insecurity on risk taking and reward seeking in an undergraduate Ivy League population. Secondly, this project identifies a key indicator in performance: executive control. 

### Methods Used
* Poisson regression (log-linear model)
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* R 

## Project Description
This projects' input includes 2021 qualtrics survey and behavioral data from the Developmental Context and Life History Strategies study. Using multivariate poisson regressions, I verified the interaction between food security status, executive control, and risk/reward tolerance. 

Measures:
Food Security - The Subset of the Core US Household Food Insecurity Scale Measure (Blumberg, et al., 1999); The  Radimer/Cornell  Measure  of  Hunger  and  Food  Insecurity Measure  (Radimer,  2002)

Executive Control - The Arizona Life History Battery: Insight, Planning, and Control (20 items) (adapted from Brim et al., 2000; Figueredo et al., 2004, 2007)

Risk & Reward - The Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System Scales (Vandeweghe  et  al.,  2016); The Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (Torrubia et al., 2001; Vandeweghe et al., 2016); Balloon Analogue Risk Task (Lejuez et al., 2002).
